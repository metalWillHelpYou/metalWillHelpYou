# 👋 Hello there 
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
# ✍️ About me
✌️ My name is Daniil, I am 21 years old. I started learning Swift in **2022**. I plan to develop my application soon.

🎓 Now I'm studying at [TBU](https://www.utb.cz/en/) as a **software engineer**. I have interaction experience with game engines such as **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**. 

I'm also interested in HTML & CSS.
